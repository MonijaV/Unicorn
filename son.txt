A son is a source of joy, love, and pride in a family. He grows with dreams, strength, and the values instilled by his parents. A son’s bond with his family is filled with care, respect, and responsibility. He learns from life’s experiences and strives to make his loved ones proud. Whether young or grown, a son always holds a special place in the hearts of his family.
